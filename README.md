Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## Credits

I got starter code from this repo provided by my bootcamp course: https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/cautious-meme

I also referenced code from module 19 activities 26 and 28 from my coding bootcamp class notes.
